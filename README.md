# EDA it_salaries
This repository contains an analysis of salary data for a company. The data was collected over a period of 5 years and includes information on employee salaries, job titles, departments, and other related factors.
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
The goal of this analysis is to explore the salary data and answer the following questions:

What is the distribution of salaries across different job titles?
Are there any significant differences in salaries between different departments?
How have salaries changed over the 5-year period?
To answer these questions, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the salary dataset. This will involve cleaning and preprocessing the data, visualizing the data to gain insights, and performing statistical analysis to test hypotheses.
<h1>Tools Used</h1>
The analysis was performed using Python programming language and several data analysis and visualization libraries, including:

pandas - for data manipulation and cleaning
matplotlib and seaborn - for data visualization
scipy - for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
The code used in the analysis can be found in the salary_analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

The dataset is provided in a CSV file (IT Salary Survey EU 2020.csv) located in the data folder.
